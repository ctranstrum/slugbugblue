    <h1>Have you lost your way?</h1>
    <p>It happens to the best of us. We think life is going along just fine.</p>
    <p>Then boom. File not found. Whatever that's supposed to mean.</p>
    <p>All you know is that nothing seems to work.</p>
    <p>And you start to wonder what you did wrong. You question everything.</p>
    <p>"Is this somehow my fault? Who am I? What am I doing here? Is there even a God anymore?"</p>
    <p>And worst of all: "Am I a dog person or a cat person?"</p>
    <p>The one sure thing you thought you knew. Now, though ... ?</p>
    <p>Has your whole life been a lie?</p>
    <p>Yes, probably.</p>
    <p>Error 404</p>
